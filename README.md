# 🏡 House Price Prediction - Boston Housing Dataset

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting house prices using the **Boston Housing Dataset**.  
By applying **Machine Learning techniques**, the model analyzes various factors such as crime rate, number of rooms, property age, and location to estimate housing prices accurately.

## ✨ Features
- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Feature selection and correlation analysis  
- Implementation of regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)  
- Model evaluation using metrics like RMSE, R² Score, and MAE  
- Visualization of key housing price factors  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**  
- **NumPy, Pandas** - Data handling  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** - Visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** - Machine Learning models  

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used is the **Boston Housing Dataset**, available in `sklearn.datasets`.
